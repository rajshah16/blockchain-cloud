# Blockchain-Cloud-App

AlgoBharat Hackathon — Submission for Team One & Zero.

Project Title: Blockchain Cloud App

Description: Blockchain-Cloud-App is a Web3 Cloud DApp that can be used to easily manage your files and folders using distributed storage on the blockchain. One can use these distributed storages such as the Filcoin Network, the Swarm Network and the Arweave Network. We use smart contracts as a file manager to search the file indexes, designed to be supported by multiple chains.

This DApp also has a built-in NFT marketplace called Web3NFT, so you can mint your own NFTs with your uploaded images, audios and videos. People can vote to like or dislike your NFTs and reward, sell and buy the NFTs so that the creators can earn through the NFTs. That is cool and representative of the future. To keep the high quality of the NFTs—the total supply being limited to a maximum of 15000, and one user can mint a maximum of 5. We make some simple DAO functions for the NFT owners by means of which they can create vote events such as changing the maximum supply or changing the maximum number of tokens that the user can mint and so on.
